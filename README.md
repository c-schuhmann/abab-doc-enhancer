# abab-doc-enhancer

Small Chrome extension to "enhance" my experience with the official ABAP documentation.

## Why

There are some things about the web version of the [SAP ABAP documentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_751_index_htm/7.51/en-us/abenabap.htm)
documentation, which bug me sometimes. For example, most of the hyperlinks in this document are JavaScript calls to get to another page,
which means I can't just click the link with the middle mouse wheel to open it in another tab. And yes. This bugs me.

So I thought: Lets just take [this](https://blog.lateral.io/2016/04/create-chrome-extension-modify-websites-html-css/) blogpost and create an extension

## Features

- Replace JavaScript links with actual links (finally able to open links in a new tab)

## How to use this extension

Be warned: This is mostly for myself and I won't guaratee, that this thing will work for other people. Expect this to break at any time.
